  <h1>Welcome to CRISP Knowledge Graph!</h1>
  <p>The CRISP Knowlege Graph aims to establish the backbone of information integration for gathering Austrian infrastructure systems pertinent for crisis management. It offers a comprehensive and collective view of urban infrastructure, service networks, and diverse environmental indicators. By connecting data on population, medical services, weather, transport, and utilities, CRISP KG gives users a way to understand how interconnected systems react to crisis and shock situations. CRISP KG is built on the foundation of three core elements: event of hazards, geographical regions, and infrastructure networks. These three elements are cornerstones of our crisis management framework and its functionality. The CRISP KG is currently undergoing active development; however, it is accessible through a <a href="/sparql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SPARQL interface</a>.
